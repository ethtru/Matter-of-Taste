## Installation

After createing the database using mySQL, run npm install followed by npm start to get the server up and running.

## Usage

To get started using the application, you must first log in. The `/login` route renders a form to log in and a form to create a new account. Once logged in, a session will be created. You are now able to view the recipe libary and add a recipe of your own. You can access the form to create a new recipe in the database by clicking the 'Add Recipe' button. This will "POST" a recipe to the databse by way of the new-recipe.js file.
